# Reading-Notes

A growth mindset is a way of thinking that involves making a constant effort to change the *way* a person is thinking,
changing things like "I can't do x thing" to "I can't do x thing *yet*".

Three reminders I can tell myself are:
- Rephrase sentencing
- Learn through repetition
- Build habits around struggle
